#Potential Student Projects

+ Monitor actual platform pose vs inputs and propose control software enhancements to improve accuracy
+ Implement digital filters to create motion cues for movements beyond physical range of platform
+ Implement method to automatically adjust the system for the current load+ + 
+ Implement machine learning to calculate required festo inputs to achieve desired pose for various loads
+ Create motion sim suitable for platform using animation software such as Unity, Blender, Java 3D, etc
+ Create an input device for synthesizing telemetry for a motion video (similar to Space Coaster)
+ Design and implement a diagnostic module to monitor system and aid maintenance at events
